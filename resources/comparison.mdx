## Common Misconceptions

### "Managed services are always easier"

**Reality:** Initial setup is faster with managed services, but:
- You may spend more time working around limitations
- Debugging issues without source code access is harder
- Customization requires waiting for provider support
- Better Auth's setup is a one-time investment

### "Self-hosted means more security risk"

**Reality:** Both have trade-offs:
- Managed: Trust provider's security, but also their vulnerabilities
- Self-hosted: Your responsibility, but you control updates and patching
- Better Auth is open source: community reviews = more eyes on security

### "Managed services scale better"

**Reality:** 
- Both can scale to millions of users
- Better Auth gives you more control over performance optimization
- Database scaling is the real bottleneck for both
- Managed services can have rate limits or throttling

### "Per-user pricing is fair"

**Reality:**
- Costs grow linearly with success
- Can become largest infrastructure expense
- Auth0 example: 500K users = $35K/month = $420K/year
- Better Auth: Infrastructure stays ~$200/month regardless

## Conclusion

There's no universal "best" authentication solution. The right choice depends on your:

- **Budget**: Better Auth wins at scale, managed services win for small projects on free tier
- **Control needs**: Better Auth for customization, managed for convenience
- **Team size**: Better Auth for technical teams, managed for non-technical teams
- **Timeline**: Managed services faster initially, Better Auth faster long-term
- **Philosophy**: Open source vs proprietary, self-hosted vs managed

Better Auth aims to provide:
1. **Best-in-class DX** - Great developer experience with TypeScript
2. **Cost efficiency** - No per-user pricing, just infrastructure
3. **Complete control** - Own your data and customize freely
4. **Modern features** - Passkeys, SSO, organizations, and more
5. **Active development** - Regular releases and community support
